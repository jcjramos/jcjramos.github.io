A long time ago, during the 80’s in the last millennium I’ve got a Sinclair ZX Spectrum as a gift …Instead of playing PacMac I’ve became fascinated how you could write a few commands and that tiny machine would do some many interesting stuff ( I was an odd kid …). Soon I’ve bought a book about Basic in a used bookstore and start leaning it, eventually discovered that I love doing that and wanted to do that as a career.</p>
<p>Although I don’t like Basic much these days I still love programming, I tend to use Java or C++ now. Currently I help do develop cool car software. I&rsquo;m mostly focused in sdupporting teams working on embedded systems, altougth I don’t program as much as I used to I’m still very closely involved with the Software development process.</p>
<p>After so many years working on Software I’ve decided in 2018 to create my on blog. As I really don’t like the way the Web is going these days, with more and more content behind walled gardens, I though about creating a old fashioned blog available for everyone who wishes to read it.</p>
<h2 id="some-topics-im-likelly-to-cover-">Some topics I&rsquo;m likelly to cover :</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kubernetes &amp; Docker microservices</li>
<li>Cloud Computing &amp; Virtualization</li>
<li>Privacy &amp; Software Security</li>
<li>Software Architecture</li>
<li>Software development &amp; Java</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-additional-comments-">Some additional comments :</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that English is not my first language, I’m a native Portuguese speaker, please don’t be offended if my use of English looks “odd”.</p>
<h2 id="some-credits-for-this-site-">Some credits for this site :</h2>
<ul>
<li>This blog name is a obvious inspiration from the well know ( and very interesting to read for many years ) blog Schneier on Security <a href="https://www.schneier.com/">https://www.schneier.com/</a>.</li>

<h2 id="new-home-on-github">New home on GitHub</h2>
<p>Originally this blog was hosted in wordpress, in the end of 2018 I&rsquo;ve decided to move it to github and use a static generator ( <a href="https://www.gohugo.io">https://www.gohugo.io</a> ) to manage it. Reasonin is that this way I can handle the blog with much of the same tools that I use in everyday Software development. A plus is that the Markdown format is quite good to handle code examples, and I plan to focus on tuturials and technical aspects.</p>
