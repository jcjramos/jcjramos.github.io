      <description>“E-Government” has been quite a trendy buzzword all around Europe, according to the UN E-Government survey Portugal ranks 29 in worldwide E-Government services which is not great but not too bad either. For sake of comparison number 1 is Denmark, Belgium is 28 and Poland 33.
Anyway It is cool that many public services have been made available online. I just wonder what the ranking would be if they considered security.</description>

      <description>Last week, CUF hospital, one of the biggest Portuguese private hospitals was attacked by ransomware, you can read about it here if you can read Portuguese.
seems that the the SamSam ransomware was used, likely by the same grupo that has been targeting hospitals around the globe .
There are not many details available, the Hospital claims that “Everything is normal”, but apparently some exams were lost, likely encrypted by the ransomware, as they refused to pay for the ransom.</description>

      <description>The short answer is you don’t know … there is no simple ways to check, web infrastructure these days is complex and there is no public reporting of security practices used or even testing reports. The web owner can ( and will if they care about security ) use some kind of vulnerability testing, but it’s actually not nice to test 3rd party sites for vulnerabilities and generally people don’t make these public.</description>

      <title>About Spectre &amp; Meltdown</title>

      <description>For several reasons Meltdown and Spectre are a very interesting set of vulnerabilities that illustrates well the challenges involved to create secure software applications these days.
Details &amp;amp; more info in :
https://meltdownattack.com/
Some semi random thoughts about it :    Although not so risky as been portrayed in the press, basically both vulnerabilities are related to isolation - means that a potential attacker can use them to get information on the local computing device, not to attack remote systems.</description>
