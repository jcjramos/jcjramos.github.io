This past week, a New Zealand man was looking through the data Facebook had collected from him in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467?helpref=page_content">an archive</a> he had pulled down from the social networking site. While scanning the information Facebook had stored about his contacts, Dylan McKay discovered something distressing: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/03/facebook-scraped-call-text-message-data-for-years-from-android-phones/">Facebook also had about two years worth of phone call metadata from his Android phone</a></p>
