<p>Anyway It is cool that many public services have been made available online. I just wonder what the ranking would be if they considered security. It is relatively simple to push public services online,  but if these are not properly secured this can create more serious problems than the ones it solves.</p>
<p>For example recently in Portugal a student named Miguel Moura found out that the main Finance portal has some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very basic vulnerabilities. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the scariest part is that it took him quite some time to report the problem, looks like security was not a major priority when they thought about put online a large database with lot’s of info about Portuguese people.</p>
<p>Local IRS database has info not only about your revenue, the properties and vehicles you own and e-Factura with more basic info about paid invoices … a hacker can quickly find out where I had lunch yesterday – quite scary !</p>
