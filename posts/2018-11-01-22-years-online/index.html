<p>At the time, defenitly during the late 90&rsquo;s I’ve used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities">Geocities</a> , a free hosting service at the time that eventually was bought by Yahoo.
To have an online presence during the web early days mean that you would have to hack your own html static pages, get a crappy background and deploy it on Geocities. The portal was organized in a “neighbourhood” fashion, depending on the theme of your site you would pick the appropriate neighbourhood – at the time I was still a student and quite interested in game development, thus my site was about C++ game development using Microsoft Direct X that was kind of a new technology at the time.
Geocities was closed in 2009, but I could find my “old” site in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000816161746/http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/3098/">web achieve</a></p>

<p>Seems that I’ve put it online in 1.11.1996, kind of funny to see that &ldquo;what goes online stays online&rdquo; 22 years latter.</p>
