<h2 id="telco-closed-loop-automation">Telco: Closed loop automation</h2>
<p>Everyone in Telco seems to be working on a solution involving closed loop automation this year. Basically it is the concept of creating a system detecting a problem and actually taking measures to fix it. Of course some problems are easier to fix than others, and now all solutions are as straightforward as restarting a Network element ( this is actually a common used solution &hellip;) thus the available systems vary in terms of capabilities. Many are just “repackaged” evolutions of previously existing applications that handle limited use cases.
Eventually Closed Loop Automation will be a major necessity for telcos, 5G networks are complex and imply the explosion of the number of Elements in a Network. Many current maintenance tasks must be automated, or telcos workforces will have a huge increase.</p>
<h2 id="dev-machine-learning">Dev: Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Algorithms that gain insights from data have been better and better, in some specific areas are actually very good and you see quite amazing results. The major issue limiting the ML applications these days is the lack of data, you need tons of data to properly “train” an algorithm and in the “real world” outside the online domains this data is simply not available. Join this with the more awareness of the privacy implications of ML, adding up to new laws like European GDPR and it seems that it will take a while for proper ML to take off.</p>
