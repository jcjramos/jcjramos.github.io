<p>There is a huge array of equipment necessary to enable you to use your mobile phone with minimal issues, your operator has lots of radio equipment spread around that enables your phone to communicate with the network and a core network that enables the data to travel around ( this is of course a huge simplification ).
Lot’s of equipment spread in larger areas means of course lot’s of problems, there are the obvious equipment malfunctions, there are power breakdowns and even more “unexpected” events like someone stealing a network antenna.
Telco operators employ lot’s of people and use sophisticated software to ensure that their systems are functional, this is a growing challenge as more and more equipment is necessary to support newer network standards like 5G.
Several functions of the Telco OSS systems, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_support_system"> OSS meaning Operations Support System </a> not Open Source Software, involve something like :</p>

<ol>
<li>There’s network data coming in (a) -&gt; <br /></li>
<li>Data is analysed by a pre-programmed set of rules -&gt; <br /></li>
<li>Automated corrective actions are performed (b) -&gt; <br /></li>
<li>Problem Tickets are created for the problem to be accessed manually <br /></li>
</ol>

<p>Looking at this workflow, it is not so hard to think how AI, in particular machine learning can be used to improve existing systems. One of the areas of Machine Learning is Supervised Learning, it is used in most of the practical implementations of machine learning these days and it basically consists on an algorithm that can be trained and corrected by a teacher.</p>

<p>A “training” system could consist in something like : <br />
<br />
Stored network historical data + Stored historical problems  = Automatic generated rules
<br />
<br />
And then a live AI based system : <br />
1. network data coming in -&gt; <br />
2. Data is analysed by automatic generated rules -&gt;  <br />
3. Automated corrective actions are performed ( c ) -&gt; <br />
4. Problem Tickets are created for the problem to be accessed manually
<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
( a )   Including Performance data and fault data generated from network elements<br />
( b )   Tipically simple actions like a Reboot <br />
( c )   As these could be “trained” as well the ratio of problems that need manual human intervention should be reduced as well<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess most Telcos and respective software suppliers are think of this; but there are a number of challenges to overcome in order to have a functional system – will try to talk about them in a future post. Anyway whoever does this right might revolutionize telco software.</p>
