<ul>
<li>
<p>Personally Iâ€™ve been trying to focus on important things and say no to other stuff that ends up consuming a lot of energy but is not that relevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professionally as a Product Owner I got to say no a lot ! actually I think the art to say no is one of the most important characteristics of a good PO.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you say yes to everyone youâ€™ll get a lot of friends in the fist place but they soon will be mad at you when they find out that you cannot deliver all the items that you promised or you deliver a messy inconsistent product.
Saying no itâ€™s actually an important part of your Job, actually coming up with ideas is easy â€“ everybody has one, but itâ€™s up to you to decide what should be implemented first and the development team capability is limited, also some ideas might good or feasible but they donâ€™t fit the product long term vision or they donâ€™t bring so much value in the short termâ€¦how to handle it ? say no ! a lot â€¦ it might not make you the most popular PO in the company, thus it is a good to take some time explain why, even if the idea sounds a bit dumb at the first time. Also there is a defence between a straight No and a No But, some ideas might not be interesting right now but they might be relevant in the future or they might have be interesting if modified a bit.</p>
<p>One of the most important challenges in Software Product development is to implement the right stuff, even if you get to work with the largest and most competent development team in the universe there will always be constrains thus been very carful with priorities and what you decide to work on is very important.</p>
<p><em>A curiosity note that Iâ€™ve remembering when writing this post : In most of the west european languages, at least the ones I know a bit, the word for no is quite similar â€¦ you can say no to a Portuguese, a Spanish, a French, a German and they will get it â€¦ one thing that I found quite surprising and confusing when Iâ€™ve visited Greece for the first time a few years ago is that the Greek word for No is Ohi â€¦ that actually sounds like Oui that is the French word for yes, to make things more difficult the Greek word for Yes itâ€™s actually Ne that looks a lot more like No ðŸ˜Š  So, say no a lot except if you are in Greece.</em></p>
<p><em>And other note is that : Iâ€™ve actually borrowed the title for this post from [a well known book] (<a href="https://markmanson.net/)">https://markmanson.net/)</a>.</em></p>
