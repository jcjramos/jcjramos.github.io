Knowing that the average salary in Portugal is roughly 50% lower than Germany and it’s just 1h time difference, it’s easy to understand that this can be a very lucrative model.</p>
<p>Things start to change during the Portuguese debt crisis during the early 2010’s, due to the dim opportunities at home many Portuguese youngsters moved to other European countries – moving abroad was particularly easy for the “IT crowd” given that their skills were in high demand abroad and usually it’s not a job requirement to know any other language besides English.  This together with the fact that Portugal is a member of the EU and people can basically just decide to move other country and work there without much hassle.</p>
<p>The emigration numbers were high but never high enough to significantly disrupt the industry, moving abroad is not for everyone and with time tired of living in a diferent country/culture with a lousy weather many did come back. Salaries in Portugal are lower but cost of live is also lower, an IT salary can easily be 2 or 3 times the average and you can still make a  good living here.</p>
<p>But now a diferent trend seems to emerge, I don’t know the exact dimension, but seems to be getting significative. Now what happens is that the IT professionals are “nearshoring themselves”, basically working directly ( and remotely ) to European companies abroad. Seems a win/win situation,  companies get skilled people in a dificult market, they are already remote, so it’s not a big deal if your new employee is in Portugal - anyway he/she can travel to your office in central Europe in a few hours.  And people get a German or English wage with a Portuguese cost of living.</p>
<p>No one knows what will be of the post pandemic world, bellow some of my guesses If this trend continues :</p>
<ul>
<li>Typical Portuguese “consultancy” companies will have an hard time recruiting, many might close</li>
<li>Others might adapt by hiring remotely also, maybe “lusoshoring” ( outsourcing to lower cost Portuguese speaking countries like Brazil ? )</li>
<li>In Portugal we will have a high number of well paid ( by local terms ) IT professionals, although this is definitely good news for the involved ( and for many business ) it might be messy in terms of social cohesion.</li>
<li>Additionally a high number of “digital nomads” or just other IT people from diferent European countries working remotely might relocate to Portugal given the good climate and relatively safe environment.</li>
<li>The current IT industry in Portugal is mostly focused in Lisbon and Porto, with a few companies in Aveiro, Braga or Coimbra. With time remote professionals might be more widely spread through the country.</li>
</ul>
<p>Likelly the most relevant changes will be others that we do now forsee rigth now. Time will tell.</p>
