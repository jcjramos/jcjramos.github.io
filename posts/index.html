      A recent problem that one of the teams I work with faced, related to a major DB vendor and a set of different incompatible patches remind me of the 90’s. During the late 90’s I’ve worked for a Windows shop that developed a huge DLL based application, taking care of dependencies was a nightmare…early MS win 95 versions didn’t include any good mechanism to track DLL versions, also initially this was not a major concern when developing our application, but we end up creating a lot of DLLs and with additional dependencies from SO and 3rd party DLL’s, so I know fist hand what “DLL hell” means.

      Helm is one of the best tools available to simplify your kubernetes development. In this post I’ll be adding some tips that might help you in the development of your helm charts.
Btw, you migth like to see this previous post and eventually this one
Tip 1 – Files in configmaps There are cases where you will need to move existing configuration files to config maps, a hard working solution is to just type in the whole file with the proper config map indentation.

      One of the side effects of a microservices architecture is that checking logs soon becomes a problem. At the beginning of the process, when you think about containerizing an application, it seems simple and straightforward – you just log to stdout and docker or kubernetes handle it. But then &hellip;
Where is my log ? The number of different services &amp; service instances rapidly explodes and then it becomes really difficult to find a particular log and to troubleshoot the misbehaviour of a micro-service.

      Manage deployments is a import concern when creating a microservices based application, given the typical huge number of services involved and the possible variations you need a way to keep complexity under control. Helm can be a usefull tool, besides been a very cool way to define dependencies ( see this previous post ), Helm introduces an interesting concept called values ( not quite original, but implemented in a nice way ).

      Techies love BuzzWords, every year there is new popular technology or concept that everyone talks about, soon these fall in to oblivion and are replaced by new trends. Not all the Buzzwords referrer to completely useless stuff, some concepts really got past the Buzz part and became really useful parts of our lives, but eventually people got tired to discuss them, or they became too common to be interesting ( I guess Blog was a buzzword a few years ago ).

      Microservices are supposed to be small and dedicated, the issue when you move an application to a microservices based architecture is that you quickly get many of them. Dealing with each service individually becomes much easier as they get more “micro”, but deal with the whole bunch can be a nightmare. Look at the example bellow, in the 1st interaction of a typical application it became something like this :

        Telco Software : Virtualization vs Cloudification

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Today I came across this very interesting article on The Economist regarding “Cloudification will mean upheaval in telecoms”, it’s kind of “old news” but make me think about the current trends in telco software development. From my experience telco industry was fast to virtualize but slot to cloudify. Virtualization and cloudification are often used with the same meaning but they are actually different concepts. Virtualization is mostly related to the optimization of hardware resources, running more software on a given amount of physical infrastructure.

      Sometimes, in particular when moving large legacy systems to a microservices architecture you came up with the dilemma, what to do about the not-so-microservices ? these are typically large monolith blocks from a bygone era. Developers are afraid of these, no one want’s to mess with them. But we live in a messy world with lot’s of IT infrastructure relying on old code – it is not possible to rewrite all the old code in a “container friendly” way.

      Deploying http services in a Kubernetes cluster can be a bit challenging, although the basic principles are simple it is not always easy to manage all the details. Docker &amp; Kubernetes were designed with isolation in mind ( they are called containers for a reason ). You need to understand the Ingress triology properlly : Ingress -&gt; Service -&gt; Containers.
The Container The fist step is to have the container running, inside the container there is a service running that accepts HTTP connections – let’s say tomcat running a webserver.
