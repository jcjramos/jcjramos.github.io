      <description>“There is a way of being wrong which is also sometimes necessarily right.” - Edward Abbey MVP stands for minimum viable product, and it is a popular thing between Agile software developers. A MVP is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development. Software developers typically deploy the product to a subset of possible customers to get feedback and be able to grasp a proper product vision.</description>

      <description>Trying to make some sense of docker for non-technical people. Do you think it is more expensive to send a container full of goods from Lisbon to China or a plane ticket that allows one of you to go to from Lisbon to China? Actually it is roughly the same, the prices vary but on average the costs are around 1200 €.
It is surprising that it is relatively cheap to transport such a huge container full of goods.</description>

      <description>I’ve been wondering a lot about the importance of saying no recently:
  Personally I’ve been trying to focus on important things and say no to other stuff that ends up consuming a lot of energy but is not that relevant.
  Professionally as a Product Owner I got to say no a lot ! actually I think the art to say no is one of the most important characteristics of a good PO.</description>

      <description>I really like this article I’ve read in Increment [The epistemology of software quality] ( https://increment.com/teams/the-epistemology-of-software-quality/ )
Say you run a new team. You have carte blanche to implement any policies you want to make the team more productive and the code less buggy. What do you do? You could choose a new programming language, or switch everything to microservices, or follow the hottest trend in process. Or you could do things that matter.</description>

      <description>While having some training on machine learning, I’ve been thinking in how it could be applied to telco software.
There is a huge array of equipment necessary to enable you to use your mobile phone with minimal issues, your operator has lots of radio equipment spread around that enables your phone to communicate with the network and a core network that enables the data to travel around ( this is of course a huge simplification ).</description>

      <description>I’ve found out this week that the famous Joel test reached 19 years of age this month, besides reminding me how old I’m getting it reminded me of the importance of proper CI/CD - [Continuous Integration] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) / [Continuous Delivery] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) pipelines in software development.
At the time I’ve came across “Joel Test”, found that comply with rule number 2 migth be a good thing and I’ve tried to create a simple build script that would emulate a kind of basic CI pipe – at the time I was working on a application composed of a set of components based on Win32 DLL’s+EXE; my CI script would compile the necessary DLL’s, join them in a directory and check if it run.</description>

      <description>Today I’ve come across a post in Quora about the “end of Java”, kind of funny these doomsday predictions regarding programming languages.
I’ve starting to learn programming somewhere around the late 80’s when I was a kid, at the time I’ve learn basic … it was the most common language for kids who owned “PC’s” with 48k of memory. Basic programs tended to be quite difficult to read and one thing that you learn from experience ( sometimes the hard way ) is that it is generally much difficult to maintain and evolve computer software than to initially write it, thus putting effort in to make it clean and adaptable pays off.</description>

      <description>A recent problem that one of the teams I work with faced, related to a major DB vendor and a set of different incompatible patches remind me of the 90’s. During the late 90’s I’ve worked for a Windows shop that developed a huge DLL based application, taking care of dependencies was a nightmare…early MS win 95 versions didn’t include any good mechanism to track DLL versions, also initially this was not a major concern when developing our application, but we end up creating a lot of DLLs and with additional dependencies from SO and 3rd party DLL’s, so I know fist hand what “DLL hell” means.</description>

      <description>Helm is one of the best tools available to simplify your kubernetes development. In this post I’ll be adding some tips that might help you in the development of your helm charts.
Btw, you migth like to see this previous post and eventually [this one] (../2019-01-04-more-about-helm-values/)
Tip 1 – Files in configmaps There are cases where you will need to move existing configuration files to config maps, a hard working solution is to just type in the whole file with the proper config map indentation.</description>

      <description>One of the side effects of a microservices architecture is that checking logs soon becomes a problem. At the beginning of the process, when you think about containerizing an application, it seems simple and straightforward – you just log to stdout and docker or kubernetes handle it. But then &amp;hellip;
Where is my log ? The number of different services &amp;amp; service instances rapidly explodes and then it becomes really difficult to find a particular log and to troubleshoot the misbehaviour of a micro-service.</description>

      <description>Manage deployments is a import concern when creating a microservices based application, given the typical huge number of services involved and the possible variations you need a way to keep complexity under control. Helm can be a usefull tool, besides been a very cool way to define dependencies ( see this previous post ), Helm introduces an interesting concept called values ( not quite original, but implemented in a nice way ).</description>

      <description>Techies love BuzzWords, every year there is new popular technology or concept that everyone talks about, soon these fall in to oblivion and are replaced by new trends. Not all the Buzzwords referrer to completely useless stuff, some concepts really got past the Buzz part and became really useful parts of our lives, but eventually people got tired to discuss them, or they became too common to be interesting ( I guess Blog was a buzzword a few years ago ).</description>

      <description>Microservices are supposed to be small and dedicated, the issue when you move an application to a microservices based architecture is that you quickly get many of them. Dealing with each service individually becomes much easier as they get more “micro”, but deal with the whole bunch can be a nightmare. Look at the example bellow, in the 1st interaction of a typical application it became something like this :</description>

      <title>Telco Software : Virtualization vs Cloudification</title>

      <description>Today I came across this very interesting article on The Economist regarding “Cloudification will mean upheaval in telecoms”, it’s kind of “old news” but make me think about the current trends in telco software development. From my experience telco industry was fast to virtualize but slot to cloudify. Virtualization and cloudification are often used with the same meaning but they are actually different concepts. Virtualization is mostly related to the optimization of hardware resources, running more software on a given amount of physical infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, in particular when moving large legacy systems to a microservices architecture you came up with the dilemma, what to do about the not-so-microservices ? these are typically large monolith blocks from a bygone era. Developers are afraid of these, no one want’s to mess with them. But we live in a messy world with lot’s of IT infrastructure relying on old code – it is not possible to rewrite all the old code in a “container friendly” way.</description>

      <description>Deploying http services in a Kubernetes cluster can be a bit challenging, although the basic principles are simple it is not always easy to manage all the details. Docker &amp;amp; Kubernetes were designed with isolation in mind ( they are called containers for a reason ). You need to understand the Ingress triology properlly : Ingress -&amp;gt; Service -&amp;gt; Containers.
The Container The fist step is to have the container running, inside the container there is a service running that accepts HTTP connections – let’s say tomcat running a webserver.</description>

      <description>Everyday there is a new story about a hacking incident somewhere, developing secure applications is definitely one of the most important challenges in the software world.
A good analogy is the defence of a castle, in the medieval world castles were very important. In a anarchic world with many threads they were the centres of power and stability. But how to defend a castle from your enemy’s ? a well built castle in a high point was a clear advantage, will a relatively small force it could be defended against a much powerful enemy.</description>

      <description>Thinking about the differences between life now and “before the internet” remind me that many years ago, just a bit after I’ve started to use the internet I’ve created a web site…is is true that &amp;ldquo;what goes online stays online&amp;rdquo; ?
At the time, defenitly during the late 90&amp;rsquo;s I’ve used [Geocities] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) , a free hosting service at the time that eventually was bought by Yahoo. To have an online presence during the web early days mean that you would have to hack your own html static pages, get a crappy background and deploy it on Geocities.</description>

      <description>“E-Government” has been quite a trendy buzzword all around Europe, according to the UN E-Government survey Portugal ranks 29 in worldwide E-Government serviceswhich is not great but not too bad either. For sake of comparison number 1 is Denmark, Belgium is 28 and Poland 33.
Anyway It is cool that many public services have been made available online. I just wonder what the ranking would be if they considered security. It is relatively simple to push public services online, but if these are not properly secured this can create more serious problems than the ones it solves.</description>

      <description>Last week, CUF hospital, one of the biggest Portuguese private hospitals was attacked by ransomware, you can read about it here if you can read Portuguese.
seems that the the SamSam ransomware was used, likely by the same grupo that has been targeting hospitals around the globe.
There are not many details available, the Hospital claims that “Everything is normal”, but apparently some exams were lost, likely encrypted by the ransomware, as they refused to pay for the ransom.</description>

      <description>Last weekend was a 47 hour oddity; across Europe it is like this every last weekend of March due to the annual DST change to “Summer Hour”. It is annoying but I know if could be worse, at least these changes are unified and regulated, thus all the counties that are part of the EU &amp;ldquo;unified clock regime&amp;rdquo; make the change in the same day.
These changes tend to remind me of years ago when I’ve worked in a software that processed Television audiences, what to do with the GAP when the clock jumps from SAT 1:00 AM to SAT 2:00 AM ?</description>

      <description>The short answer is you don’t know … there is no simple ways to check, web infrastructure these days is complex and there is no public reporting of security practices used or even testing reports. The web owner can ( and will if they care about security ) use some kind of vulnerability testing, but it’s actually not nice to test 3rd party sites for vulnerabilities and generally people don’t make these public.</description>

      <description>On the scope on the GDPR there was some recent news in Portugal regarding Government guidelines for online public services. Atually public service security is an important issue as in Portugal we have lot’s of personal info in public sites, for example a service call eFactura stores basically every invoice where you have put a VAT number – thus very valuable info.
The new guidelines are still under discussion, but a kind of pre-release showed up today in todays specialized press.</description>

      <description>The economist on “self driving cars” Particularly interesting is this part regarding privacy “AVs will record everything that happens in and around them. When a crime is committed, the police will ask nearby cars if they saw anything. Fleet operators will know a great deal about their riders”.
Wired on China “Big Brother” Social Credits approachKind of old news, but found it last week …&amp;ldquo;Imagine a world where many of your daily activities were constantly monitored and evaluated… It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to picture, because most of that already happens….</description>

      <description>Data is new Oil, I don’t know who came up with the analogy, I think I’ve read it 1st on Wiredbut it really highlight’s the value of data these days.This should be a reminder that data is valuable, likely you wouldn’t consider sending a few bottles of gasoline to BP just because it’s fun but you produce a huge amount of data that you are giving to online companies without getting much in return.</description>

      <description>The current cryptocurrency trend brings fresh challenges to security, and should be a concern even if you, like me don’t understand where’s the fun of Bitcoin and don’t care much about it.Cryptocurrencies were one of the greatest trends in 2017, in particular the crypto “star” Bitcoin that started the year around 1000$ and ended it well above 10000$. Although I really don’t find Bitcoin particularly interesting ( just go elsewhere if you are looking for investment tips – I’m not really good at it ) I think that the concept behind it, Blockchain, has potential and can be useful in a lot of different ways.</description>

      <description>GDPR is something that is been given some headaches to people like me, involved in secure software development, it stands for “General Data Protection Regulation” ( seehttps://www.eugdpr.org/), it’s a new EU wide regulation coming from the European Parliament that impacts companies that collect or process data related to European Citizens. The GDPR will be enforced after 25 May 2018 and means potential heavy fines for non-complaint companies.Compliance will cause some concerns as according to the European Commission &amp;ldquo;personal data is any information relating to an individual, whether it relates to his or her private, professional or public life.</description>
