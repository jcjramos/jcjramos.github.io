      Deploying http services in a Kubernetes cluster can be a bit challenging, although the basic principles are simple it is not always easy to manage all the details. Docker &amp; Kubernetes were designed with isolation in mind ( they are called containers for a reason ). You need to understand the Ingress triology properlly : Ingress -&gt; Service -&gt; Containers.
The Container The fist step is to have the container running, inside the container there is a service running that accepts HTTP connections – let’s say tomcat running a webserver.

      Everyday there is a new story about a hacking incident somewhere, developing secure applications is definitely one of the most important challenges in the software world.
A good analogy is the defence of a castle, in the medieval world castles were very important. In a anarchic world with many threads they were the centres of power and stability. But how to defend a castle from your enemy’s ? a well built castle in a high point was a clear advantage, will a relatively small force it could be defended against a much powerful enemy.

      Thinking about the differences between life now and “before the internet” remind me that many years ago, just a bit after I’ve started to use the internet I’ve created a web site…is is true that &ldquo;what goes online stays online&rdquo; ?
At the time, defenitly during the late 90&rsquo;s I’ve used Geocities , a free hosting service at the time that eventually was bought by Yahoo. To have an online presence during the web early days mean that you would have to hack your own html static pages, get a crappy background and deploy it on Geocities.

      NotPetya The Untold Story of NotPetya, the Most Devastating Cyberattack in History. Fear At the Open Source Summit, Window Snyder, Chief Security Officer at Intel, explains why fear is not a good motivator for improving cyber-security and provides insight into how to improve software defenses. Security  In today&rsquo;s world, computers are now so omnipresent that there is no longer any such thing as cybersecurity, online security, or computer security – there&rsquo;s only security.

      “E-Government” has been quite a trendy buzzword all around Europe, according to the UN E-Government survey Portugal ranks 29 in worldwide E-Government services which is not great but not too bad either. For sake of comparison number 1 is Denmark, Belgium is 28 and Poland 33.
Anyway It is cool that many public services have been made available online. I just wonder what the ranking would be if they considered security.

      Last week, CUF hospital, one of the biggest Portuguese private hospitals was attacked by ransomware, you can read about it here if you can read Portuguese.
seems that the the SamSam ransomware was used, likely by the same grupo that has been targeting hospitals around the globe .
There are not many details available, the Hospital claims that “Everything is normal”, but apparently some exams were lost, likely encrypted by the ransomware, as they refused to pay for the ransom.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Last weekend was a 47 hour oddity; across Europe it is like this every last weekend of March due to the annual DST change to “Summer Hour”. It is annoying but I know if could be worse, at least these changes are unified and regulated, thus all the counties that are part of the EU &ldquo;unified clock regime&rdquo; make the change in the same day.
These changes tend to remind me of years ago when I’ve worked in a software that processed Television audiences, what to do with the GAP when the clock jumps from SAT 1:00 AM to SAT 2:00 AM ?
