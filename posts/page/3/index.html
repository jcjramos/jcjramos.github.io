BGR on Slingshot
A nation-state developed a piece of malware so powerful that it can steal everything that’s happening on a computer without even being install on the target device itself. Instead, it resides on a router. It’s called Slingshot and it was recently discovered by Kaspersky Labs.

      The short answer is you don’t know … there is no simple ways to check, web infrastructure these days is complex and there is no public reporting of security practices used or even testing reports. The web owner can ( and will if they care about security ) use some kind of vulnerability testing, but it’s actually not nice to test 3rd party sites for vulnerabilities and generally people don’t make these public.

      On the scope on the GDPR there was some recent news in Portugal regarding Government guidelines for online public services. Atually public service security is an important issue as in Portugal we have lot’s of personal info in public sites, for example a service call eFactura stores basically every invoice where you have put a VAT number – thus very valuable info.
The new guidelines are still under discussion, but a kind of pre-release showed up today in todays specialized press.

      Data is new Oil, I don’t know who came up with the analogy, I think I’ve read it 1st on Wired but it really highlight’s the value of data these days.
This should be a reminder that data is valuable, likely you wouldn’t consider sending a few bottles of gasoline to BP just because it’s fun but you produce a huge amount of data that you are giving to online companies without getting much in return.

      The current cryptocurrency trend brings fresh challenges to security, and should be a concern even if you, like me don’t understand where’s the fun of Bitcoin and don’t care much about it.
Cryptocurrencies were one of the greatest trends in 2017, in particular the crypto “star” Bitcoin that started the year around 1000$ and ended it well above 10000$. Although I really don’t find Bitcoin particularly interesting ( just go elsewhere if you are looking for investment tips – I’m not really good at it ) I think that the concept behind it, Blockchain, has potential and can be useful in a lot of different ways.

      For several reasons Meltdown and Spectre are a very interesting set of vulnerabilities that illustrates well the challenges involved to create secure software applications these days.
Details &amp; more info in :
https://meltdownattack.com/
Some semi random thoughts about it :    Although not so risky as been portrayed in the press, basically both vulnerabilities are related to isolation - means that a potential attacker can use them to get information on the local computing device, not to attack remote systems.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      GDPR is something that is been given some headaches to people like me, involved in secure software development, it stands for “General Data Protection Regulation” ( seehttps://www.eugdpr.org/), it’s a new EU wide regulation coming from the European Parliament that impacts companies that collect or process data related to European Citizens. The GDPR will be enforced after 25 May 2018 and means potential heavy fines for non-complaint companies.
Compliance will cause some concerns as according to the European Commission &ldquo;personal data is any information relating to an individual, whether it relates to his or her private, professional or public life.
