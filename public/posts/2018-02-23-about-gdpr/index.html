The GDPR will be enforced after 25 May 2018 and means potential heavy fines for non-complaint companies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compliance will cause some concerns as according to the European Commission &ldquo;personal data is any information relating to an individual, whether it relates to his or her private, professional or public life. It can be anything from a name, a home address, a photo, an email address, bank details, posts on social networking websites, medical information, or a computer’s IP address.&rdquo; Thus the GDPR takes a wide view of what constitutes personal identification information. Companies will need the same level of protection for things like an individual’s IP address as they do for name or telephone number.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although a challenge for many companies my opinion is that more regulation on personal data is welcome, GDPR enforces some basic rights like “Right of access” or “Right to erasure” that are very important as data is more and more valuable for companies and online tools collect more and more details of our daily lives.</span></p>
