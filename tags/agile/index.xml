      <description>I’ve been wondering a lot about the importance of saying no recently:
 Personally I’ve been trying to focus on important things and say no to other stuff that ends up consuming a lot of energy but is not that relevant.
 Professionally as a Product Owner I got to say no a lot ! actually I think the art to say no is one of the most important characteristics of a good PO.</description>

      <description>I really like this article I’ve read in Increment The epistemology of software quality
Say you run a new team. You have carte blanche to implement any policies you want to make the team more productive and the code less buggy. What do you do? You could choose a new programming language, or switch everything to microservices, or follow the hottest trend in process. Or you could do things that matter.</description>
