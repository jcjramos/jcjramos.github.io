      <description>Today I came across this very interesting article on The Economist regarding “Cloudification will mean upheaval in telecoms”, it’s kind of “old news” but make me think about the current trends in telco software development.

Virtualization is mostly related to the optimization of hardware resources, running more software on a given amount of physical infrastructure.</description>
