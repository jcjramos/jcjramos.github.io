Say you run a new team. You have carte blanche to implement any policies you want to make the team more productive and the code less buggy. What do you do? You could choose a new programming language, or switch everything to microservices, or follow the hottest trend in process. Or you could do things that matter.

There is a huge array of equipment necessary to enable you to use your mobile phone with minimal issues, your operator has lots of radio equipment spread around that enables your phone to communicate with the network and a core network that enables the data to travel around ( this is of course a huge simplification ).

From my experience telco industry was fast to virtualize but slot to cloudify. Virtualization and cloudification are often used with the same meaning but they are actually different concepts. Virtualization is mostly related to the optimization of hardware resources, running more software on a given amount of physical infrastructure.

      I’ve found out this week that the famous Joel test reached 19 years of age this month, besides reminding me how old I’m getting it reminded me of the importance of proper CI/CD - Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery pipelines in software development.
At the time I’ve came across “Joel Test”, found that comply with rule number 2 migth be a good thing and I’ve tried to create a simple build script that would emulate a kind of basic CI pipe – at the time I was working on a application composed of a set of components based on Win32 DLL’s+EXE; my CI script would compile the necessary DLL’s, join them in a directory and check if it run.

      Manage deployments is a import concern when creating a microservices based application, given the typical huge number of services involved and the possible variations you need a way to keep complexity under control. Helm can be a usefull tool, besides been a very cool way to define dependencies ( see this previous post ), Helm introduces an interesting concept called values ( not quite original, but implemented in a nice way ).

      Microservices are supposed to be small and dedicated, the issue when you move an application to a microservices based architecture is that you quickly get many of them. Dealing with each service individually becomes much easier as they get more “micro”, but deal with the whole bunch can be a nightmare. Look at the example bellow, in the 1st interaction of a typical application it became something like this :

      Deploying http services in a Kubernetes cluster can be a bit challenging, although the basic principles are simple it is not always easy to manage all the details. Docker &amp; Kubernetes were designed with isolation in mind ( they are called containers for a reason ). You need to understand the Ingress triology properlly : Ingress -&gt; Service -&gt; Containers.
The Container The fist step is to have the container running, inside the container there is a service running that accepts HTTP connections – let’s say tomcat running a webserver.

      I’ve found out this week that the famous Joel test reached 19 years of age this month, besides reminding me how old I’m getting it reminded me of the importance of proper CI/CD - Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery pipelines in software development.
At the time I’ve came across “Joel Test”, found that comply with rule number 2 migth be a good thing and I’ve tried to create a simple build script that would emulate a kind of basic CI pipe – at the time I was working on a application composed of a set of components based on Win32 DLL’s+EXE; my CI script would compile the necessary DLL’s, join them in a directory and check if it run.

      Today I’ve come across a post in Quora about the “end of Java”, kind of funny these doomsday predictions regarding programming languages.
I’ve starting to learn programming somewhere around the late 80’s when I was a kid, at the time I’ve learn basic … it was the most common language for kids who owned “PC’s” with 48k of memory. Basic programs tended to be quite difficult to read and one thing that you learn from experience ( sometimes the hard way ) is that it is generally much difficult to maintain and evolve computer software than to initially write it, thus putting effort in to make it clean and adaptable pays off.

At the time, defenitly during the late 90&rsquo;s I’ve used Geocities , a free hosting service at the time that eventually was bought by Yahoo.

Cryptocurrencies were one of the greatest trends in 2017, in particular the crypto “star” Bitcoin that started the year around 1000$ and ended it well above 10000$. Although I really don’t find Bitcoin particularly interesting ( just go elsewhere if you are looking for investment tips – I’m not really good at it ) I think that the concept behind it, Blockchain, has potential and can be useful in a lot of different ways.

      For several reasons Meltdown and Spectre are a very interesting set of vulnerabilities that illustrates well the challenges involved to create secure software applications these days.
Details &amp; more info in :

Some semi random thoughts about it :    Although not so risky as been portrayed in the press, basically both vulnerabilities are related to isolation - means that a potential attacker can use them to get information on the local computing device, not to attack remote systems.

Say you run a new team. You have carte blanche to implement any policies you want to make the team more productive and the code less buggy. What do you do?

There is a huge array of equipment necessary to enable you to use your mobile phone with minimal issues, your operator has lots of radio equipment spread around that enables your phone to communicate with the network and a core network that enables the data to travel around ( this is of course a huge simplification ).

      I’ve found out this week that the famous Joel test reached 19 years of age this month, besides reminding me how old I’m getting it reminded me of the importance of proper CI/CD - Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery pipelines in software development.
At the time I’ve came across “Joel Test”, found that comply with rule number 2 migth be a good thing and I’ve tried to create a simple build script that would emulate a kind of basic CI pipe – at the time I was working on a application composed of a set of components based on Win32 DLL’s+EXE; my CI script would compile the necessary DLL’s, join them in a directory and check if it run.

      Today I’ve come across a post in Quora about the “end of Java”, kind of funny these doomsday predictions regarding programming languages.
I’ve starting to learn programming somewhere around the late 80’s when I was a kid, at the time I’ve learn basic … it was the most common language for kids who owned “PC’s” with 48k of memory. Basic programs tended to be quite difficult to read and one thing that you learn from experience ( sometimes the hard way ) is that it is generally much difficult to maintain and evolve computer software than to initially write it, thus putting effort in to make it clean and adaptable pays off.

      A recent problem that one of the teams I work with faced, related to a major DB vendor and a set of different incompatible patches remind me of the 90’s. During the late 90’s I’ve worked for a Windows shop that developed a huge DLL based application, taking care of dependencies was a nightmare…early MS win 95 versions didn’t include any good mechanism to track DLL versions, also initially this was not a major concern when developing our application, but we end up creating a lot of DLLs and with additional dependencies from SO and 3rd party DLL’s, so I know fist hand what “DLL hell” means.

      Techies love BuzzWords, every year there is new popular technology or concept that everyone talks about, soon these fall in to oblivion and are replaced by new trends. Not all the Buzzwords referrer to completely useless stuff, some concepts really got past the Buzz part and became really useful parts of our lives, but eventually people got tired to discuss them, or they became too common to be interesting ( I guess Blog was a buzzword a few years ago ).

      Everyday there is a new story about a hacking incident somewhere, developing secure applications is definitely one of the most important challenges in the software world.
A good analogy is the defence of a castle, in the medieval world castles were very important. In a anarchic world with many threads they were the centres of power and stability. But how to defend a castle from your enemy’s ? a well built castle in a high point was a clear advantage, will a relatively small force it could be defended against a much powerful enemy.

        Telco Software : Virtualization vs Cloudification

      Today I came across this very interesting article on The Economist regarding “Cloudification will mean upheaval in telecoms”, it’s kind of “old news” but make me think about the current trends in telco software development. From my experience telco industry was fast to virtualize but slot to cloudify. Virtualization and cloudification are often used with the same meaning but they are actually different concepts. Virtualization is mostly related to the optimization of hardware resources, running more software on a given amount of physical infrastructure.

      The current cryptocurrency trend brings fresh challenges to security, and should be a concern even if you, like me don’t understand where’s the fun of Bitcoin and don’t care much about it.
Cryptocurrencies were one of the greatest trends in 2017, in particular the crypto “star” Bitcoin that started the year around 1000$ and ended it well above 10000$. Although I really don’t find Bitcoin particularly interesting ( just go elsewhere if you are looking for investment tips – I’m not really good at it ) I think that the concept behind it, Blockchain, has potential and can be useful in a lot of different ways.

      For several reasons Meltdown and Spectre are a very interesting set of vulnerabilities that illustrates well the challenges involved to create secure software applications these days.
Details &amp; more info in :

Some semi random thoughts about it :    Although not so risky as been portrayed in the press, basically both vulnerabilities are related to isolation - means that a potential attacker can use them to get information on the local computing device, not to attack remote systems.
