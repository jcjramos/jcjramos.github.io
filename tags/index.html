A good analogy is the defence of a castle, in the medieval world castles were very important. In a anarchic world with many threads they were the centres of power and stability. But how to defend a castle from your enemy’s ? a well built castle in a high point was a clear advantage, will a relatively small force it could be defended against a much powerful enemy.

      The current cryptocurrency trend brings fresh challenges to security, and should be a concern even if you, like me don’t understand where’s the fun of Bitcoin and don’t care much about it.
Cryptocurrencies were one of the greatest trends in 2017, in particular the crypto “star” Bitcoin that started the year around 1000$ and ended it well above 10000$. Although I really don’t find Bitcoin particularly interesting ( just go elsewhere if you are looking for investment tips – I’m not really good at it ) I think that the concept behind it, Blockchain, has potential and can be useful in a lot of different ways.

      For several reasons Meltdown and Spectre are a very interesting set of vulnerabilities that illustrates well the challenges involved to create secure software applications these days.
Details &amp; more info in :
https://meltdownattack.com/
Some semi random thoughts about it :    Although not so risky as been portrayed in the press, basically both vulnerabilities are related to isolation - means that a potential attacker can use them to get information on the local computing device, not to attack remote systems.

      Everyday there is a new story about a hacking incident somewhere, developing secure applications is definitely one of the most important challenges in the software world.
A good analogy is the defence of a castle, in the medieval world castles were very important. In a anarchic world with many threads they were the centres of power and stability. But how to defend a castle from your enemy’s ? a well built castle in a high point was a clear advantage, will a relatively small force it could be defended against a much powerful enemy.

      The current cryptocurrency trend brings fresh challenges to security, and should be a concern even if you, like me don’t understand where’s the fun of Bitcoin and don’t care much about it.
Cryptocurrencies were one of the greatest trends in 2017, in particular the crypto “star” Bitcoin that started the year around 1000$ and ended it well above 10000$. Although I really don’t find Bitcoin particularly interesting ( just go elsewhere if you are looking for investment tips – I’m not really good at it ) I think that the concept behind it, Blockchain, has potential and can be useful in a lot of different ways.

      For several reasons Meltdown and Spectre are a very interesting set of vulnerabilities that illustrates well the challenges involved to create secure software applications these days.
Details &amp; more info in :

Some semi random thoughts about it :    Although not so risky as been portrayed in the press, basically both vulnerabilities are related to isolation - means that a potential attacker can use them to get information on the local computing device, not to attack remote systems.
