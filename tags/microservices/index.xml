      <description>One of the side effects of a microservices architecture is that checking logs soon becomes a problem. At the beginning of the process, when you think about containerizing an application, it seems simple and straightforward – you just log to stdout and docker or kubernetes handle it. But then &amp;hellip;
Where is my log ? The number of different services &amp;amp; service instances rapidly explodes and then it becomes really difficult to find a particular log and to troubleshoot the misbehaviour of a micro-service.</description>

      <description>Manage deployments is a import concern when creating a microservices based application, given the typical huge number of services involved and the possible variations you need a way to keep complexity under control. Helm can be a usefull tool, besides been a very cool way to define dependencies ( see this previous post ), Helm introduces an interesting concept called values ( not quite original, but implemented in a nice way ).</description>

      <description>Microservices are supposed to be small and dedicated, the issue when you move an application to a microservices based architecture is that you quickly get many of them. Dealing with each service individually becomes much easier as they get more “micro”, but deal with the whole bunch can be a nightmare. Look at the example bellow, in the 1st interaction of a typical application it became something like this :</description>

      <description>Sometimes, in particular when moving large legacy systems to a microservices architecture you came up with the dilemma, what to do about the not-so-microservices ? these are typically large monolith blocks from a bygone era. Developers are afraid of these, no one want’s to mess with them. But we live in a messy world with lot’s of IT infrastructure relying on old code – it is not possible to rewrite all the old code in a “container friendly” way.</description>

      <description>Deploying http services in a Kubernetes cluster can be a bit challenging, although the basic principles are simple it is not always easy to manage all the details. Docker &amp;amp; Kubernetes were designed with isolation in mind ( they are called containers for a reason ). You need to understand the Ingress triology properlly : Ingress -&amp;gt; Service -&amp;gt; Containers.
The Container The fist step is to have the container running, inside the container there is a service running that accepts HTTP connections – let’s say tomcat running a webserver.</description>
