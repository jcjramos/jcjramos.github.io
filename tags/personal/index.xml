      <description>Thinking about the differences between life now and “before the internet” remind me that many years ago, just a bit after I’ve started to use the internet I’ve created a web site…is is true that &amp;ldquo;what goes online stays online&amp;rdquo; ?
At the time, defenitly during the late 90&amp;rsquo;s I’ve used Geocities , a free hosting service at the time that eventually was bought by Yahoo. To have an online presence during the web early days mean that you would have to hack your own html static pages, get a crappy background and deploy it on Geocities.</description>
